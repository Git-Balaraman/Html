    <h1>About Html</h1>

        <dt>
            <h2>Early Beginnings (1980s)</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>The concept of hypertext, which allows text to be linked and interconnected, was developed by computer
            scientist Ted Nelson. This laid the foundation for the World Wide Web. Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer
            scientist working at CERN, proposed the idea of a global hypertext system in 1989.</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>HTML Emerges (Early 1990s)</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>Tim Berners-Lee, along with his colleagues at CERN, created the first HTML specification in 1990. This early
            version of HTML, known as HTML 1.0, was a simple markup language designed for creating basic documents with
            hyperlinks.</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>HTML Evolves (Mid-1990s)</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>As the web gained popularity, the need for more features became apparent. In 1993, HTML 2.0 was published as
            an official specification. It introduced features like forms and tables</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>Browser Wars (Late 1990s)</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>The late 1990s saw the "Browser Wars" between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Both
            browsers introduced their own proprietary HTML extensions, leading to compatibility issues</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>HTML4 (Late 1997)</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>HTML 4.0 became a W3C recommendation in December 1997. It included support for frames, scripting with
            JavaScript, and more sophisticated forms.</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>XHTML (Early 2000s)</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) emerged as an attempt to combine the flexibility of XML with
            the structure of HTML. XHTML 1.0 was introduced in 2000. It emphasized the importance of well-formed
            documents.</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>HTML5 (2008)</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>HTML5 development began in the mid-2000s as a response to the shortcomings of previous HTML versions. It
            aimed to provide a more robust and versatile language for web development. HTML5 introduced new elements
            like video, audio, canvas, and improved support for multimedia and interactivity.</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>Modern Web (2010s and Beyond)</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd> HTML5 became the new standard for web development, and it continues to evolve. Alongside CSS3 for styling
            and JavaScript, it forms the basis for modern web applications. Web standards, accessibility, and responsive
            design have become integral to web development practices.</dd>

        <dt>
            <h2>HTML Living Standard</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>In 2012, the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) started maintaining the HTML Living
            Standard, which provides continuous updates and improvements to HTML. It is developed in an open and
            collaborative manner and serves as the de facto HTML specification.</dd>

    </dl>
    <h3>HTML has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a simple markup language. It has evolved to support the
        dynamic and interactive web we know today, with ongoing developments and refinements to meet the demands of
        modern web development.</h3>
